Time-Machine Dynamic Bulk Packet Recorder
=========================================

Time-Machine is a bulk packet recorder with some special 
features for tuning and operation.

For more documentation, research publications, and community contact
information, please see the Time Machines's home page:

To compile and link, we can do the following:
sudo ./configure --enable-debug --prefix=<path_to_binary_file_and_config_file>
sudo make -j 8 && sudo make install
(the -j 8 lets it make with 8 processors)

To run, do the following:
sudo ./timemachine -r <path_to_pcap_file> -c <path_to_config_file>

One example way to compile and run is:
sudo ./configure --enable-debug --prefix=/home/lakers/tm
sudo make -j 8 && sudo make install
sudo ./timemachine -r <fullpathnametopcapfile> -c </home/lakers/tm/etc/timemachine.cfg.in>

To exit, press Ctrl + D

To do querying for ipv6 addresses, please use brackets around the ipv6 address.
So, for example,
query to_file "testquery.pcap" index ip "[2001:558:fe0d:1c::2]"

Not using brackets around an ipv6 address will result in a querying error.
