Most significant changes since the last release:

* Many bugfixes and performance improvements.
	* New connection table code (with less locking)
	* New index hash tables
	* Disk write performance
* Coupling with IDS through broccoli.
* Support for dynamic classes: The TM can be instructed to (temporarily)
