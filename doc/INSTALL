TimeMachine needs:
  - libpcap
  - libpthreads
  - libreadline
  - cmake

Optional:
  - broccoli

Configure and compile:
	./configure
	make

If you have Bro installed in it's default <prefix> of
/usr/local/bro, then this configure command will build
timemachine with Bro support.

    ./configure --with-broccoli=/usr/local/bro
